# Multilingual_PDF_Summarizer

## Overview

PDF Summarization and Translation is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of extracting meaningful insights from PDF documents in different languages. Leveraging advanced natural language 

processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models, the application offers a seamless experience for users to upload PDF files, summarize their content and translate the summaries into multiple languages.

## Key Features

**PDF Upload**: Users can easily upload PDF files directly to the application.

**Summarization**: The application employs state-of-the-art summarization models to condense the content of PDFs into concise summaries.

**Chunking**: Automatically divides lengthy summaries into manageable chunks for efficient translation and processing.

**Multilingual Translation**: Translates the summaries into a wide range of languages, enabling cross-cultural communication and accessibility.

**Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multiprocessing to accelerate the summarization and translation tasks, optimizing performance.

**Streamlit Interface**: Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, making it accessible to users of all technical levels.

## How It Works

**Upload PDF**: Users upload their PDF files through the application interface.

**Summarization**: The application extracts text from the PDF and summarizes it using advanced NLP models.

**Translation**: The summaries are translated into the selected language(s) using a pre-trained multilingual translation model.

**Display**: Translated summaries are displayed to the user for review and further action.

## Setup Instructions

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
